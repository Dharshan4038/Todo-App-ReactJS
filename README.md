# Todo Application
The Todo App is built using ReactJS that allows users to create, manage, and search for tasks or todos. It provides a user-friendly interface for organizing and keeping track of various tasks and It uses **Json Server** to store the tasks of the user.

When the app loads, it presents a list of existing tasks, each represented as a separate item. Users can add new tasks by entering a task description in an input field and clicking an "Add" button. The newly added tasks appear in the list along with the existing ones.

The app also includes a search bar where users can enter keywords or phrases related to specific tasks they want to find. As users type in the search bar, the app dynamically filters the task list, displaying only the tasks that match the search criteria. This functionality allows users to quickly locate and focus on specific tasks within a large list.

The Todo App leverages React's component-based architecture to create reusable components for managing tasks, displaying the task list, and handling user interactions. React's state management capabilities are utilized to store and update the list of tasks, as well as to filter the tasks based on the search query.

By combining React's powerful features with an intuitive user interface, the Todo App with Searchbar showcases how ReactJS can be used to create a responsive and efficient task management application. It provides a practical example of how React can simplify the process of organizing and searching for tasks, enhancing productivity and organization.
